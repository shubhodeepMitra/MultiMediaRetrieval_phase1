# CSE 515 - Phase 1

In the first phase there are three task.

Task 1: 
Take ImageID and Feature Descriptor as input and print out the computed feature descriptor.

execute code/task1.py


Task 2:
Compute all feature descriptor for all image IDs and save them as numpy array.

execute code/parallel.py

Task 3:
Given an Image ID and an input K, compute K similar images to the given image ID.

The result is plotted, where each row contains the k similar images for a feature descriptor.

execute code/similar_query.py
